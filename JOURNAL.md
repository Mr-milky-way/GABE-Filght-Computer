# May 24th: Started on the PCB and BOM

I set up my repo, started to make the PCB layout and a BOM (I know there is a better way to route, but I think it looks cool)

Time Spent: 3h 31m

# May 26th: Changed PCB layout and added more to the BOM

I decided that remaking the teensy 4.1 as the fist thing was a bad idea and switched to the breakout board insted, I'm about 60% with the schematic and BOM.

# June 4th: Started work on custom Teensy 4.1 and added a level shifter to the servo lines

I started work on remaking the teensy removed the I2C level shifter and added one to the PWM lines, I also swaped all the capacitors and resistor parts from 603 to 805.

# June 5th: Just about done remaking the teensy

I got close to finnishing the teensy but I might change it around just to make it look nice, didn't really change the BOM that much.

# June 7th: Finished the teensy bit, and made updates to the BOM

I finished the Teensy and added mosfets, I also updated the BOM. About one hour in, I went "I'm just going to make this one with one microprocessor", this is because this is the first time I've made a board like this before (custom teensy thingy) and I only want one place where it can go wrong. If this one works well, I might make a varatint with 3 microprocessors just to make it look nice.
